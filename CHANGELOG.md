# A changelog for the lib/hyperglot language database and CLI tool (dd.mm.yyyy)

## 0.7.0 (WIP)
- DATA: All language yaml documents now have their `contributors` listed, some have `reviewers` listed
- DATA: **Massive* improvement of language `sources` with proper source citations where possible
- DATA: Added `punctuation`, `numerals` and `currency` attributes to orthographies
- DATA: Added `lib/hyperglot/extra_data/default.yaml` to include inheritable defaults per script
- FEATURE: Orthography attributes can inherit from other languages with `<iso>` syntax, see [README](README_database.md)
- TWEAK: Orthographies can no longer have an `inherit` attribute
- TWEAK: Improved loading speed for repeat queries and indivudal language queries
- TWEAK: Refactored `Languages`, `Language` and `Orthography` object instantiation to always return parsed and defaulted nested objects
- TWEAK: Cleaned up multiple CLI options:
  - Added `--check` option to replace `--supportlevel`. `--check` takes any value of `base,auxiliary,punctuation,numerals,currency,all` or a comma-separated list of those
  - Removed `--include-historical` and `--include-historical` in favor or `--status` which accepts any combination of `LanguageStatus` or "all", defaults to "living"
  - Removed `--include-all-orthographies` in favor of `--orthography` which accepts any combination of `OrthographyStatus` or "all", defaults to "primary"
  - Removed the `--speakers` and `--autonym` CLI options
  - Removed the `--comparison` CLI option (see `examples` instead)
  - Removed the `--languages` CLI option, use `hyperglot-info LanguageName/ISO` instead
  - Removed the `--strict_iso` CLI option; use the python library to access this option, particularly `Language.get_name(script, strict_iso=True)`
- Removed the deprecated `STATUSES`, `ORTHOGRAPHY_STATUSES` and `SUPPORTLEVELS` from the codebase

- FEATURE: Introduced `hyperglot.language.Orthography` abstraction for easier access of parse lists vs yaml raw character strings
- TESTS: More refactored Languages, Language and new Orthography tests

## 0.3.0 (09.04.2021)
- DATA: Changed the way `marks` and decomposition are handled in the data entry and saving
- DATA: `base` and `auxiliary` may now contain unencoded base + mark character combinations without those getting decomposed on saving
- DATA: Updated approximately 50-100 languages which previously had unencoded base + mark combinations not saved in their character sets, since those were not unicode characters - this update added and retains those unencoded combinations for more comprehensive listing of the orthographies
- DATA: Marks are now always placed on `◌` in the data for easier readability
- CLI: Default checking (without `-m`) no longer requires implicit combining marks, meaning those which are retrieved from decomposing the characters - the default check will still require those marks, which are explicitly listed in `marks` and are not the result of decomposing the characters
- CLI: Introduced `-m/--marks` as a flag to require all marks for a support level check
- CLI: Changed `-m/--mode` to `-c/--comparison`

- Data: 
- FIX: Fixed issue that caused to parse some fonts (#24)
- TWEAK: Allow inheriting an orthography without explicitly having a script present in the orthography, this will inherit the primary script orthography of the parent

## 0.2.4 (18.03.2021)
- First `pip` release :)

- FEATURE: Implemented `--include-all-orthographies` to check all but `deprecated` orthographies and changed default behaviour to only list `primary` orthographies
- TWEAK: Implemented treating orthographies with `preferred_as_group` as one for checks
- TWEAK: Languages with multiple `primary` orthographies will match if one is supported
- TWEAK: `Languages` can be initiated with `pruneRetainDecomposed` to keep any precomposed characters from the database when using `prune` (which decomposes them to base + mark)
- TWEAK: Improved tests for CLI and improved and fixed some parsing tests
- FIX: Marginal cases fixed where using `parse_chars` and already parsed lists would merge a mark with a predeceding base glpyh and result in a erraneous list of base/aux characters
- DATA: Added uppercase to bicameral scripts
- DATA: All languages now have a `primary` orthography
- DATA: Introduced `preferred_as_group` orthography attribute
- TESTS: Config to ignore other library's warnings

## 0.2.1 (03.02.2021)
- DATA: Updated and added many scripts and languages and their speaker counts

## 0.2.0 (28.01.2021)
- FEATURE: Added `--decomposed` flag that determines if a font is required to have all glyphs of a language as code points, or if supporting all combining marks is sufficient
- TWEAK: Renamed module and database to `hyperglot`
- TWEAK: `--strict-support` refactored to `--validity` with default `weak` to pick the level of required validity on the languages that should get matched
- TWEAK: Saving and validating enforces removal of superflous mark characters that are getting implicitly extracted via glyph decomposition
- TWEAK: Detection automatically extracts all required mark glyphs for languages and the database has been pruned of any no longer required mark glyphs listed. Using the `hyperglot-save` will apply this pruning and save the database in its cleaned up state
- TESTS: Added tests for the Language and Languages class
- TESTS: Added test for the CLI options running against actual font files
- DOCS: Overhauled and updated the README to all latest changes

## 0.1.14 (27.5.2020)

- FIX: Improved character set parsing from database properly decomposing any combining characters into their parts and checking against those
- TESTS: Added first pytest for above case

## 0.1.12 (14.5.2020)
- FEATURE: Added `--strict-support` flag (default False) to explicitly trigger warning about languages with unconfirmed status. Since those languages have well researched charset information but just have not been confirmed by several expert sources we still want to include them in the count. Using `--strict-support` excludes (but lists separately) all those languages which we have not been able to confirm
- TWEAK: Renamed `--strict` flag to `--strict-iso` to be more discriptive
- TWEAK: Database file linking, one more time... as per 0.1.10

- FIX: Refactored `setup.py` to include the databased file relative to the package

## 0.1.9 (19.2.2020)
- FIX: "Inverted" the `preferred_as_individual` outcome, e.g. those languages should suppress any included languages from being listed and be listed as one language instead

## 0.1.7 & 0.1.8 (18.02.2020)
- FIX: Made sure `preferred_as_individual` in fact also removes the language that is being inheritted from the matches
- TWEAK: Update `fontlang-save` and sorting to not include inheritted attributes
- TWEAK: Updated and fixed validation for `status` attributes

## 0.1.6 (07.02.2020)
- FEATURE: Implemented support for the `preferred_as_individual` attribute on macro languages
- FEATURE: Added `--strict` flag to display language names and macrolanguages as per ISO data
- TWEAK: Implemented orthography attribute `inherit` to inherit another language's orthography for that `script` (if one exists)

- TWEAK: Updated `fontlang-validate` to spec

## 0.1.5 (30.01.2020)
- FIX: More robust relative file path loading for database file
- TWEAK: `-o` output is now of same structure for single file input, and indexed by file name for several file input
- TWEAK: `-o` filters the languages' orthographies to only supported ones
- TWEAK: Added validation check to confirm orthographies have a 'script'
- TWEAK: Refactored validation script to `fontlang-validate` CLI command
- TWEAK: Languages without orthographies that are included in macrolanguages that do have orthographies silently inherit the macrolanguage's orthographies
- FEATURE: Added `fontlang-save` CLI command to re-save the `rosetta.yaml` sorted alphabetically
- FEATURE: Added `--include-historical` and `--include-constructed` flags to include those languages in results
- FEATURE: Added `--version` and `--verbose` flags

## 0.1.4 (28.01.2020)
- FEATURE: Added `-m` option ('individual', 'union', 'intersection') to compute a support comparison of several passed in fonts
- TWEAK: You can now pass in any number of font paths. By default one after the other is analyzed
- TWEAK: Make sure to print `preferred_name` if available

## 0.1.3 (23.01.2020)
- TWEAK: Merged `fontlang` with Rosetta Language DB repo
- TWEAK: Updated data structure in YAML and added `Language` class for convenience

## 0.1.2
- FEATURE: `-o` flag to specify an output yaml file path
- FEATURE: `-n` flag to display language names in native spelling (where available)
- FEATURE: `-u` flag to display language users (if available)
